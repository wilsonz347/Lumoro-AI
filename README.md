## Overview

Many students and early-career technical creators struggle to **present their projects effectively** for job applications, scholarship competitions, or networking on platforms like LinkedIn. Translating complex technical achievements into polished, audience-appropriate bullet points or posts is time-consuming and often limits opportunities.

**Lumoro AI** is an **AI-powered web app** that automates this process. Users paste a project description, README, or hackathon summary, and the app generates polished, tailored outputs for three key use cases:

- **Resume bullets** – concise, achievement-focused statements  
- **LinkedIn posts** – conversational and networking-friendly  
- **Competition bullets** – highlights innovation, teamwork, and measurable results  

By improving presentation skills and reducing entry barriers, Lumoro AI empowers students to **showcase their potential confidently** and access broader opportunities, democratizing career growth and inclusion.
